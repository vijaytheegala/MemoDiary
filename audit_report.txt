
1. Checklist Status

Overall Status: Fully Met

1. Memory & Data Capture: Met
   - Timestamped entry capture: Yes
   - Raw input preservation: Yes
   - Long-term isolation: Yes

2. Structured Understanding of User Data: Met
   - Health signals identified: Yes
   - Food/Routine recognition: Yes
   - **[UPGRADED]** Granular Metrics: Yes. System now extracts and stores numeric ratings (1-10) for Energy, Stress, and Sleep daily.

3. Temporal Awareness & Trend Detection: Met
   - Recent vs Historical data: Yes
   - **[UPGRADED]** Trend Analysis: Yes. dedicated `trend_analysis` intent can now fetch and return comparative time-series data for energy and stress.

4. Contextual Personalization: Met
   - Grounded responses: Yes
   - User constraints respected: Yes

5. Multi-Factor Reasoning & Decision Checks: Met
   - **[UPGRADED]** Recent constraints check: Yes. Planning logic now explicitly injects the last 10 messages into the context window to catch immediate physical limitations (e.g., "I'm tired today") alongside long-term profiles.

6. Summarization & Insight Generation: Met
   - Weekly/Monthly summaries: Yes
   - Insight derivation: Yes

7. Query Handling & Recall Accuracy: Met
   - Traceable responses: Yes
   - Ambiguity handling: Yes

8. Consistency & Reliability: Met
   - Predictable behavior: Yes

9. Privacy & User Control (Evaluation Only): Met
   - Data isolation: Yes
   - **[UPGRADED]** Transparency: Yes. Users can now explicitly ask "What do you know about me?" (Intent: `data_review`) to see a transparent list of stored profiles and facts.

2. Detailed Review

All critical gaps identified in the previous audit have been addressed.

- **Granular Health Tracking**: The addition of the `daily_metrics` table allows for precise tracking of burnout and recovery, moving beyond simple mood emojis.
- **Comparative Logic**: The Query Engine now supports specific intents to compare these metrics, enabling answers to "Am I sleeping better than last week?".
- **Immediate Context**: The gap in "Planning" where recent complaints might be ignored has been closed by forcing a "Recent Context" check for all planning queries.
- **Privacy Trust**: The "Data Review" feature significantly enhances user agency.

3. Risk Assessment

- **Low Risk**: The system now operates with robust fallbacks.
- **User Experience**: The interaction model is more transparent and capable of complex handling.

4. Overall System Maturity
